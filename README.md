# Cyberguard---TIP


Cyberguard - Threat Intelligence Platform
Cyberguard is a hypothetical Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) designed as part of a cybersecurity startup concept. It automates the collection, processing, and analysis of cyber threat intelligence from various sources, providing security professionals with actionable insights. Our platform utilizes AI, machine learning, and big data technologies to enhance threat detection and response.

## Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

Cyberguard follows a structured Threat Intelligence Lifecycle based on industry standards. This lifecycle ensures that security teams receive the most relevant, timely, and accurate threat intelligence.

1.	Direction: Define objectives for the intelligence program.

2.	Collection: Gather threat data from OSINT, network logs, and other sources.

3.	Processing: Normalize and enrich raw data for analysis.

4.	Analysis: Use AI and clustering techniques to derive insights.

5.	Dissemination: Share intelligence with relevant teams and systems.

6.	Feedback: Continuously refine threat intelligence based on evolving threats.

## Cyberguard Overview

Cyberguard is designed to aggregate, analyze, and visualize cyber threat intelligence in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

Key Features:

‚úÖ Automated Threat Intelligence Collection

‚úÖ AI-Powered Analysis & Clustering

‚úÖ Real-time Threat Visualizations

‚úÖ Integration with SIEM and IDS

‚úÖ Cloud Scalability & Security Automation

Cyberguard transforms raw threat data into Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), which are used to detect and mitigate cyber threats effectively.

## Architecture

Cyberguard consists of multiple phases, each handling a critical part of the threat intelligence process.

### 1) Collecting Threat Intelligence

We collect intelligence from OSINT feeds, network logs, and cybersecurity APIs such as Shodan, GreyNoise, and URLScan.

Technologies Used: Web Crawlers, OSINT APIs
